The script records periodic measurement data and transfers it to the Cloud server. The interval for recording and
transmitting measurement data can be configured. The connection type can also be configured. If the "online" connection
type is selected, the measurement data is transmitted to the server as soon as the measurement data is created. The
battery voltage, USB charging voltage and temperature are recorded. The current operating state is indicated by the RGB-LED.
The LED lights up blue if there is an existing connection with the Cloud server. The LED flickers blue while the
connection is being established. If the last connection attempt failed, the LED flashes red until the next attempt to establish
a connection. However, if the last connection establishment was successful and the rapidM2M M3 is waiting for the next
contact with the Cloud server (e.g. during "Interval" connection mode), then the LED is switched off. A connection to the
server is either triggered automatically by the device following expiry of the transmission interval or receipt of a wakeup
SMS or manually by pressing the button.

Note: The units specified in the following relate to the exchange of data between the rapidM2M M3 and Cloud
server. When defining the connector, the "vscale" attribute can be used to adapt the units for the display on the
interface of the Cloud server or output via the REST-API. The transmission interval for the display/input is thus
converted from seconds to minutes, for example.



The script generates and transmits the following measurement values:

Measurement value:      Unit:       Explanation:
Battery voltage         mV          Voltage at the rechargeable battery connection of the rapidM2M M3	
					
                                    If the rapidM2M M3 is charged via USB, the measurement value corresponds to the
                                    charging voltage. Otherwise, the measurement value corresponds to the voltage of
                                    the connected rechargeable battery.

USB charging voltage    mV          Voltage at the USB connection of the rapidM2M M3
Temperature             0.1°C       Measurement value read out from the TMP112 (IC5) temperature sensor of therapidM2M M3




The script provides the following configuration options:

Parameter:              Unit:       Explanation:
Transmission interval   sec.        Time between transmissions
Record interval         sec.        Time between measurement data recordings
Connection type         ---         0: The device connects in the transmission cycle.
                                    1: The device connects in the transmission cycle.However, a connection can also be initiated through the server.
                                    2: The device does not disconnect the connection and continuously transmits the measurement data.
