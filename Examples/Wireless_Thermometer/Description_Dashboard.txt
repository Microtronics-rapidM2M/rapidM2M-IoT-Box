The dashboard has two views that are referred to as the "login page" and "content page" in the following. The login page,
that enables the entry of the user credentials, is initially displayed after opening the dashboard. If valid login data is
entered, this switches to the content page. In addition to issuing the latest measurement values for the battery voltage,
USB charging voltage and temperature provided by the application script, the record interval can also be entered via the
content page. The site, for which the information is displayed, is selected automatically. The first site of the first customer,
for whom the user has access rights, is selected. The selection is displayed on the content page above the area for the
measurement values. The measurement values themselves are updated at one second intervals. The logout button can be
used to switch back to the login Page, which also deactivates the measurement values from being updated. When
switching back to the login page, the user credentials entered in the input fields are not deleted. This has proven
particularly convenient for the test phase during which you frequently switch between the two views. Although this feature
should not be implemented in productive dashboards in this form under any circumstances. The dashboard also has an area
to display status information (e.g. error codes) that is available in both views.
